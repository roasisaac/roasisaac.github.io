## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a web application that works seamlessly across iPad, iPhone, desktop, and is available on the Play Store.

## Concept

The project is built around the idea of the hero’s journey and the linked concept of principles by Ray Dalio. Here's an overview of the app's design and structure:

- **Home Screen**
  - The home screen features your character with different stats. These stats represent the various sub-courses the user can take to "level up" their character.
  - Beneath the character, there are important shortcuts for journal tasks, allowing users to choose from different templates or tasks.

- **Hero’s Journey Page**
  - This page corresponds to the idea of the hero’s journey, where your character undergoes various challenges (sub-courses) to emerge as a hero.

- **Sub-Courses Page**
  - This page lists all the available sub-courses, making it easy for users to navigate and select courses to work on.

- **Profile Page**
  - Adjacent to the first page, the profile page lists the user's stats, principles, and real-life experiences.

- **Action Page**
  - The final page is dedicated to action, where users can practice leadership through templates and/or exercises.

## Challenges and Assistance Needed

- **Compatibility with Different Formats**
  - Ensuring compatibility across smartphones, iPads, desktops, etc., raises the question of whether HTML and CSS are sufficient tools for building this application.

- **Design**
  - Despite efforts to create a good design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the results have been unsatisfactory.

- **Backend**
  - The backend, built with SQLite, functions adequately, but there are issues with the sign-up process, as profiles can be created in the database but do not function as expected.
  
- **Automatic Bookmarking and Filtering**
  - All created entries shouldnt be automatically bookmarked, but this functionality is not working as intended.
  - The filter feature is also not functioning correctly.

If you know anyone who could assist with these challenges, it would be greatly appreciated!
