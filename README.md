## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide an app that works seamlessly across iPad, iPhone, desktop, and is available on the Play Store.

## Concept

The project is built around the idea of the hero’s journey and the linked concept of principles by Ray Dalio. Here's an overview of the app's design and structure:

- **Home Screen**
  - The home screen features your character with different stats. These stats represent the various sub-courses the user can take to "level up" their character.
  - Beneath the character, there are important shortcuts for journal tasks, allowing users to choose from different templates or tasks.

- **Hero’s Journey Page**
  - This page corresponds to the idea of the hero’s journey, where your character undergoes various challenges (sub-courses) to emerge as a hero.

- **Sub-Courses Page**
  - This page lists all the available sub-courses, making it easy for users to navigate and select courses to work on.

- **Profile Page**
  - Adjacent to the first page, the profile page lists the user's stats, principles, and real-life experiences.

- **Action Page**
  - The final page is dedicated to action, where users can practice leadership through templates and/or exercises.

## Challenges and How You Can Help

Building this project has been an exciting journey, but I'm facing a few challenges that could use your expertise and support:

- **Compatibility Across Devices**
  - I want the app to work seamlessly on smartphones, iPads, and desktops. Do you have experience with responsive design and cross-platform compatibility?

- **Design Refinement**
  - Despite my efforts with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the design isn't meeting my expectations. Any tips for improving user interface and experience?

- **Backend Functionality**
  - While SQLite serves as the database, there are issues with user sign-up and profile management. I need help ensuring these functions work smoothly.

- **Automatic Bookmarking and Filtering**
  - Entries created in the app should be automatically bookmarked, but this feature isn't functioning correctly. Additionally, the filter mechanism needs improvement.
